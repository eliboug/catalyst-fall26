## Development

When starting the dev server, use background mode:

```
astro dev --background
```

Manage the background server with `astro dev stop`, `astro dev status`, and `astro dev logs`.

## Project rules

- Read README.md for how the site is built and where things live.
- `members/*.json` rules live in two places that must match: `src/content.config.ts` and `scripts/check-members.mjs`.
- `point_entries` is append-only (enforced by a trigger). Fix mistakes with a negative entry; never add update or delete paths.
- Who's signed in comes from `Astro.locals.user`, which middleware loads from the `participants` row. Never trust `user_metadata` for identity; users can edit it.
- `Astro.locals.supabase` is null when `.env.local` is missing. Handle that instead of crashing.
- Every table in `public` needs RLS and explicit column grants. Change the schema with a new file in `supabase/migrations/` (`npx supabase migration new <name>`), not in the dashboard.
- Participants are beginners. Keep `members/` and CONTRIBUTING.md simple, and keep check error messages specific about how to fix the problem.
